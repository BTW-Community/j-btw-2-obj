New ToDo list!

ToDo:
 - add all mob textures to texsplit_1.5.conf
 - add misc textures from other folders than "/textures/blocks"
 - figure out how to extract 2x2 and larger paintings (texsplit_1.5.conf)
 
 - what happens if we need multiple mesh's in one block like ID 178 & 179
 
 - check all materials in blocks.conf
 - add rotation to needed blocsks
 - add mesh to blocks in blocks.conf
 - add mob models files
