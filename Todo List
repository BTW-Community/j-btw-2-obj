Ideas:
	-Secondary Camera, placed where the player is looking at
	-Player exporting

Magik:
	-Grass slabs, get em working right and proper.
	-Make connections between moulding/corners/siding work
	-Make connections of planes like glass, grate, wicker etc work, since we are using custom objs
	-Make connection for lightning rod work, when stacked ontop of each otherF
	

Sock:
	-Test visuals for snow on slabs, snow on natural vegetation
	-UV map all custom objs
    -supply magikeh with an older jmc2obj version, where it does export _a textures
